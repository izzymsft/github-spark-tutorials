# Github Spark Tutorials

A repository to try out Github Spark capabilities

## About Github Spark

Github Spark is a new tool in Copilot that turns your ideas into full-stack apps, entirely in natural language.

With GitHub Spark, you can describe what you want in natural language and get a fullstack web app with data storage, AI features, and GitHub authentication built in. You can iterate using prompts, visual tools, or code, and then deploy with a click to a fully managed runtime.

Spark is seamlessly integrated with GitHub so you can develop your spark via a synced GitHub codespace with Copilot for advanced editing. You can also create a repository for team collaboration, and leverage GitHub's ecosystem of tools and integrations.

## Who Can Use Github Spark

Anyone with a Copilot Pro+ license can use Spark.
